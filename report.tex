\section{Introduction}
Mr. Sammon is a Korean immigrant and he is good at cooking. He wants to establish his own business by openning a Korean style restaurant in Toronto. However, he doesn't know the business environment in Toronto and people's lifestyles, thus has been struggling deciding where to open his business. We would like to conduct some analysis in this report and offer him some advice regarding this question.

\section{Data}
We use three different datasets, first two are what we have been using in the last week's project, which includes lists of postal codes of Canada and the geographical information. The third data set we will use in addition is the lists of venues obtained from Foursquare. We will combine these datasets and use them to see in which neighborhood the competition is not too harsh so that Mr. Sammon has a chance to make a profit.
